#Vestfold Developers Slack Etiquette

With Vestfold Developers on Slack we hope to gather developers (and anyone interested in development) across languages, interests and experience in an open, safe and inclusive environment. With Vestfold as a starting point, we hope to create a rock-solid and attractive developer environment.

We understand that Slack may be new to many, and to assist communication between us members, we have prepared some ground rules. This document explains the expected etiquette while participating in the discussion.

##Courtesy
Be nice and polite. We do not necessarily agree on everything. It is important to have diversity and to diversity in our conversations. We must make sure to contribute in a constructive and respectful manner.

##Language
Written language can easily be misinterpreted. We must weigh our words and tone used, allowing the easiest possible can be understood. Try to avoid sarcasm; it tends to be perceived error.

##Join / Leave channels::
- Try to get a feel for how the atmosphere is in a channel. Feel free to read the channel topic and understand the ongoing conversation.
- It's okay if someone we leave a channel. Participation is strictly voluntary
- If there is a particular interest in a topic, it makes sense to create a new channel. Make love to this and share it with us at #general or #meta. Are there special interest, it can be added as standard for all new members.
- We did not wish for much fragmentation. It may be okay with channels for broad language or #java #dotnet #webdev but not for frameworks / tools (#angularjs #mongodb #visualstudio). Too much fragmentation can lead to less involvement. Are you doubt, ask the #meta.

##Ask for help
- If there is anyone who needs help or just have a question, try changing it to a relevant channel. Are you sure? Use #general.
- Do not take it personally if no one answers at once. Most of us have full time jobs and can not be online all the time. About your question disappears upwards in the call, please feel free to ask it again
- No question is too silly! Fire away!
- @here Sends warning to anyone who is active in a given channel. Use it if there is something important to anyone who is active.
- @channel Send notice to all channel. Use this responsibility fully. No one likes unnecessary alerts.

Otherwise, it is desirable that we try to be positive. It is unfortunately possible that something is being said may be perceived negatively. As a rule, have not granted a desire to be offensive, but this may be the result of a misunderstanding / miskommunikasjon. If you still feel violated, try to loose it directly with them or contact me (@pavsaund)
